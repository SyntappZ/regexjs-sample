        'Matches according to the following rules:\n\nA backslash that precedes a non-special character indicates that the next character is special and is not to be interpreted literally. For example, a \'b\' without a preceding \'\\\' generally matches lowercase \'b\'s wherever they occur — the character will be interpreted literally. But a sequence of \'\\b\' doesn\'t match any character; it denotes a word boundary.\n\nA backslash that precedes a special character indicates that the next character is not special and should be interpreted literally. See "Escaping" below for details.\n\nIf you\'re using the RegExp constructor with a string, don\'t forget that backslash is an escape character in string literals, and so to put a backslash in the pattern, you need to escape it in the string literal. /[a-z]\\s/i and new RegExp("[a-z]\\\\s", "i") create the same regular expression: an expression that searches for any letter in the range A-Z followed by a whitespace character (\\s, see below). To include a literal backslash in an expression created via new RegExp with a string literal, you need to escape it at both the string literal level and the regular expression level: /[a-z]:\\\\/i and new RegExp("[a-z]:\\\\\\\\","i") create the same expression, which would match a string like "C:\\".\n '
